# AI PM Targets (Microsoft surfaces)

## Fast router (India workloads)
1. If user wants **“answer from our SharePoint / policy”** → use **Copilot or Azure OpenAI with Azure AI Search**.
2. If user wants **“bring own data, private/VNET, enterprise controls”** → use **Azure OpenAI Service (on your data)**.
3. If user wants **“one governed agent many teams”** → use **Azure AI Foundry**.
4. If user wants **“speech/voice entry, field/sales notes”** → use **Azure AI Speech → AOAI → CRM/support**.
5. If user wants **“search first, LLM second”** → use **Azure AI Search → AOAI**.

## 1. Copilot
- Purpose: grounded M365/Dynamics experiences.
- I will demo: support copilot, policy copilot.
- Data: SharePoint / OneDrive / indexed content.

## 2. Azure OpenAI Service
- Purpose: enterprise LLM with “on your data”.
- I will demo: RAG over PRDs, support tickets.
- Must show: grounding, telemetry, safety.

## 3. Azure AI Foundry
- Purpose: build/manage/evaluate agents.
- I will demo: same use case, packaged as Foundry project.
- Must show: tool list, eval run, monitoring.

## 4. Speech
- Purpose: STT/TTS → feed LLM.
- I will demo: call → transcript → LLM → action.

## 5. Azure AI Search
- Purpose: retrieval/grounding for all above.
- I will demo: index PRDs, tickets, policies.
